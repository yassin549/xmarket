# nixpacks.toml is DISABLED - Railway should use Dockerfile instead
# If Railway is still using this file, check:
# 1. Service Settings > Builder is set to "Dockerfile"
# 2. Dockerfile Path is set correctly
# 3. Delete this file and redeploy if Railway keeps auto-detecting

# This file should NOT be used - we're using Dockerfile.backend instead
